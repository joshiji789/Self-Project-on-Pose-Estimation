Video pose estimation plays an important role in a variety of applications, such as quantifying physical exercise, recognizing sign language, and controlling full-body gestures. From RGB video frames, 33 3D landmarks are identified and background segmentation masks are applied to the whole body.  As a proxy for a person detector, the detector is inspired by the lightweight blaze face model used in Media Piper Face Detection. Two additional virtual key points are explicitly predicted which describe the human body's centre, rotation, and scale as circles. Using Leonardo's Vitruvian man as a model, we predict the midpoint of a person's hips, the radius of a circle encircling the entire body, and the incline of the line connecting the shoulder and hip midpoints.
